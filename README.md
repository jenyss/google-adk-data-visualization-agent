# google-adk-data-visualization-agent

This project is a lightweight AI agent built using Google ADK that helps you analyze and visualize data from Excel files. It supports natural language queries like "Show me a bar chart of revenue by product" and handles everything from data preview to SQL querying and Plotly visualizations.

## How It Works
* Loads Excel data and previews the structure.
* Converts your natural language questions into DuckDB SQL queries.
* Generates interactive Plotly visualizations (bar, line, pie, scatter, sankey, etc.).
* Powered by GPT-4o or Gemini or Anthropic, with multi-model support via LiteLLM.
* Ideal for exploratory data analysis, internal dashboards, and fast insights.
